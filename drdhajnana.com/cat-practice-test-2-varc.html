<br>&nbsp;The concept of 'committed bureaucracy' was much contested in the political and administrative circles. It was alleged that it would permanently damage the fabric of the services. It would create a breed of pliable civil

Not only did she express her dissatisfaction with the performance of bureaucracy, she expressed doubt about the relevance of the basic assumptions underlying the Indian bureaucracy that of neutrality, impartiality, anonymity etc. and she alleged that the bureaucrats lacked commitment. She disgustingly referred to the administrative machinery as 'the stumbling block in the country's progress' and reiterated the necessity of creating an administrative cadre committed to national objectives and responsive to Indian social needs. She found in 'committed bureaucracy' the answer to the ills of neutrality that crippled the development process in India. She had an earnest belief that only a committed bureaucracy can bring about the desired change.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;The concept of 'committed bureaucracy' was much contested in the political and administrative circles. It was alleged that it would permanently damage the fabric of the services. It would create a breed of pliable civil
<br>servants who would always say "Yes Minister" and would be ready to crawl when asked to bend by their political masters. It was also alleged that in the name of commitment the ruling party was seeking bureaucracy's
<br>alignment with the party's ideology in order to perpetuate its rule. However, it was later clarified by the government that commitment did not mean attachment to the ideology of the party in power, but a commitment to the development of the country and personal involvement of bureaucracy in the tasks as opposed to ostrich like withdrawal and isolation from politics.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Thus, if committed bureaucracy stands for a non-partisan, socially sensitive civil service, which can empathize with the politician who is genuinely, interested in progress and development of the country, then a committed civil service is more appropriate for a developing nation than having an insensitive neutral one.<br>
<br><strong>&nbsp;3.</strong> When is <strong>Committed Bureaucracy</strong> more appropriate for a developing nation?
<br><br><strong>Options:
</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong> Committed Bureaucracy more appropriate if 'Max Weber' had not proposed it.<br><strong>Option (b): </strong>Committed Bureaucracy would be more appropriate if civil servants were not pliable.<br><strong>Option (c):</strong> If Committed Bureaucracy stands for a non-partisan, socially sensitive civil service, which can empathize with the politician who is genuinely, interested in progress and development of the country.
<br><strong>Option (d):</strong> Committed Bureaucracy was never a good option for a developing nation. <br></p>

<br>&nbsp; Weber's model of bureaucracy was found inappropriate to effect the social transformation in many developing countries. In India, it received a good amount of criticism for its failure to meet the growing demands of social legislation. After two decades of independence, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, advocated the concept of committed bureaucracy. Not only did she express her dissatisfaction with the performance of bureaucracy, she expressed doubt about the relevance of the basic assumptions underlying the Indian bureaucracy that of neutrality, impartiality, anonymity etc. and she alleged that the bureaucrats lacked commitment.

Often diagnosed in patients between 45 and 65 years old, the genetic forms tend to cluster in families. Around 15 percent of the time, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is linked to a specific mutation in the GRN gene, which causes brain cells to stop making a protein called progranulin.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Previous studies have linked progranulin to parts of the cell called lysosomes, which are responsible for cleanup and other metabolic activities in cells. However, “the function of the protein, including its role in the lysosome, has remained sort of a black box,” said co-senior author Wade Harper, the Bert and Natalie Vallee Professor of Molecular Pathology in the Department of Cell Biology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Harper collaborated on the study with co-senior authors Tobias Walther and Robert Farese Jr., who were professors of cell biology at HMS and professors of molecular metabolism at Harvard Chan School when they conducted the research, as well as lead authors Sebastian Boland, a former research fellow in the Farese &amp; Walther Lab, and Sharan Swarup, a former research fellow in the Harper lab.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; The researchers initially found that progranulin-deficient human cell lines and mouse brains, as well as brain cells from patients with FTD, had an accumulation of gangliosides — lipids commonly found throughout the nervous system.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Next, the team used recently developed technology for purifying lysosomes to analyze the types and amounts of proteins and lipids present inside them. Using this technique, the scientists found that lysosomes in these cells and tissues from brains with FTD had reduced levels of progranulin, as well as lower-than-normal levels of a lipid called BMP, which is required to break down gangliosides, the lipids commonly found in the central nervous system. However, when researchers added BMP to cells, they observed that these cells accumulated far lower levels of gangliosides.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Directions (for questions 10 to 13):</strong> Read the passage below and answer the questions based on it.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; There are several different types of dementia, each with complicated genetics that involve various mutations. frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by a loss of cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, accounts for 5 to 10 percent of dementia cases. Often diagnosed in patients between 45 and 65 years old, the genetic forms tend to cluster in families. Around 15 percent of the time, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is linked to a specific mutation in the GRN gene, which causes brain cells to stop making a protein called progranulin.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Previous studies have linked progranulin to parts of the cell called lysosomes, which are responsible for cleanup and other metabolic activities in cells. However, “the function of the protein, including its role in the lysosome, has remained sort of a black box,” said co-senior author Wade Harper, the Bert and Natalie Vallee Professor of Molecular Pathology in the Department of Cell Biology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Harper collaborated on the study with co-senior authors Tobias Walther and Robert Farese Jr., who were professors of cell biology at HMS and professors of molecular metabolism at Harvard Chan School when they conducted the research, as well as lead authors Sebastian Boland, a former research fellow in the Farese &amp; Walther Lab, and Sharan Swarup, a former research fellow in the Harper lab.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; The researchers initially found that progranulin-deficient human cell lines and mouse brains, as well as brain cells from patients with FTD, had an accumulation of gangliosides — lipids commonly found throughout the nervous system.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Next, the team used recently developed technology for purifying lysosomes to analyze the types and amounts of proteins and lipids present inside them. Using this technique, the scientists found that lysosomes in these cells and tissues from brains with FTD had reduced levels of progranulin, as well as lower-than-normal levels of a lipid called BMP, which is required to break down gangliosides, the lipids commonly found in the central nervous system. However, when researchers added BMP to cells, they observed that these cells accumulated far lower levels of gangliosides.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Together, the findings suggest that progranulin in lysosomes helps maintain the BMP levels needed to prevent gangliosides from accumulating in brain cells — buildup that may contribute to FTD.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; The researchers also think that a similar lysosome-based mechanism could be relevant for neurodegenerative diseases beyond FTD<br><br>(Extracts from <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/harvard-researchers-shed-new-light-on-frontotemporal-dementia/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">SciTechDaily</a>)

Each statement can be classified as one of the following:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Facts</strong>, which deal with pieces of information that one has heard, seen or read, and which are open to discovery or verification (the answer option indicates such a statement with an '<strong>F</strong>').<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Inferences</strong>, which are conclusions drawn about the unknown, on the basis of the known (the answer option indicates such a statement with an '<strong>I</strong>'). <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Judgements</strong>, which are opinions that imply or disapproval of persons, objects, situations and occurrences in the past, the present or the future (the answer option indicates such a statement with a '<strong>J</strong>'). <br><br>&nbsp;Choose the answer that best describes the set of four statements.

Commenting on the Budget announcement, Communications Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said TRAI was expected to submit its recommendations on the spectrum to be set aside for 5G within a couple of months, adding that the auction for the airwaves would be held soon after.<strong><br>&nbsp;Statement C:</strong>&nbsp;. With the financially stressed private telecom service provider industry now reduced to a near duopoly, as Vodafone Idea continues to bleed losses and subscribers and even plans to convert some of its outstanding interest dues to the DoT into an equity stake that will make the Union government the largest shareholder, the sector’s appetite for the highly capital intensive 5G technology is unlikely to be substantial at the moment.<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement D:</strong>&nbsp;The existing mobile networks’ inadequacies in terms of reach, especially in enabling the delivery of education to remote and rural students, it may make the most sense to delay the introduction of 5G until policymakers are sure its economic payoff will outweigh the high cost.<br></p>

<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement D:</strong> as Fact.<br>
<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement A:</strong> The elevation of Charanjit Singh Channi as Chief Minister next month was an accidental outcome of internal rivalries in the Congress, the party’s announcement that he would continue in the post if it
<br>wins the Assembly election is a bold gamble.<strong><br>&nbsp;Statement B:</strong>&nbsp;The announcement of a CM candidate, though not unprecedented, is rare for the Congress, and in this instance necessitated by the uniquely volatile social dynamic in Punjab at the moment.<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement C:</strong>&nbsp;Punjab has close to 32% population of the Scheduled Caste community, while the Jat Sikh population is over 20%.&nbsp;<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement D:&nbsp;</strong>Giani Zail Singh was the last non-­Jat Sikh Chief Minister of Punjab between 1972-­77.<br></p>
