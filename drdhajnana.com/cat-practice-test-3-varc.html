For this purpose, it tried to make the tax-system integrated and broad based on the recommendations of Professor Kaldor. Although it is natural in a developing economy that indirect taxes would contribute a large share of total tax collections, having wider coverage, but it is equally important that the structure of direct taxes be so geared as to help in achieving <strong>horizontal equity</strong> (equal treatment of equals) and <strong>vertical equity</strong> (unequal treatment of unequals). Its coverage should be increased with the passage of time so as to ensure its increasing contributory share in total tax revenue. <br><br>&nbsp; One of the immediate challenge before the Income Tax Department due to a sharp increase in the number of taxpayers in the recent past is that workload has considerably increased, without a corresponding increase in the strength of assessing officers and the supplementary staff, it would be difficult for the Income Tax Department to cater to the increased workload.<br><br>&nbsp; The increasing use of e-commerce through Internet is likely to pose serious challenge to the Income Tax Department in the near future. Under electronic transactions it becomes very difficult to prove transactions because flow of information is in electronic form. This problem is further complicated when the flow of information is across the borders, more so when transaction is routed through three countries or more. The present taxation laws, based either on business connection or permanent establishment, do not provide for a solution to the problem of taxation of internet transactions. To tackle this challenge, there is an urgent need to explore all the possibilities which should enable the Indian Government to receive information of internet commerce. The suggestion of the CBDT to form an International organisation with the participation of various countries needs to be implemented at the earliest because it would help in detecting commercial or financial transactions on the internet.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;While various measures undertaken by the Government during the Post-Reform period deserve appreciation, there is need to implement such measures strictly and extend their scope. We think that there is an urgent need for reforms and improvement in the administration of direct taxes, even if it might mean increase in the cost of collection in the short-run. There is a need to lay adequate emphasis on achieving horizontal equity, i.e., equal treatment of equals in the long-run. The strength of the Income Tax Department needs to be Considerably increased to cater to the new challenges and to be in a position to develop a tax-system which would really be broad-based. <br><br><strong>&nbsp;1. </strong>According to the passage what is horizontal equality and vertical equality?<br><br><strong>Options: 

</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong> Horizontal equity - unequal treatment of unequals. Vertical equity - equal treatment of equals. 

<br><strong>Option (b):</strong> Horizontal equity - equal treatment of equals. Vertical equity - unequal treatment of unequals. 

<br><strong>Option (c):</strong> Horizontal equity - unequal treatment of equals. Vertical equity - unequal treatment of equals.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 1 to 4):</strong> Read the passage below and answer the questions based on it. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;Since Independence, the Indian Government has tried to use taxation for achieving various socio-economic objectives. For this purpose, it tried to make the tax-system integrated and broad based on the recommendations of Professor Kaldor. Although it is natural in a developing economy that indirect taxes would contribute a large share of total tax collections, having wider coverage, but it is equally important that the structure of direct taxes be so geared as to help in achieving horizontal equity (equal treatment of equals) and vertical equity (unequal treatment of unequals). Its coverage should be increased with the passage of time so as to ensure its increasing contributory share in total tax revenue. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;One of the immediate challenge before the Income Tax Department due to a sharp increase in the number of taxpayers in the recent past is that workload has considerably increased, without a corresponding increase in the strength of assessing officers and the supplementary staff, it would be difficult for the Income Tax Department to cater to the increased workload. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp; The increasing use of e-commerce through Internet is likely to pose serious challenge to the Income Tax Department in the near future. Under electronic transactions it becomes very difficult to prove transactions because flow of information is in electronic form. This problem is further complicated when the flow of information is across the borders, more so when transaction is routed through three countries or more. The present taxation laws, based either on business connection or permanent establishment, do not provide for a solution to the problem of taxation of internet transactions. To tackle this challenge, there is an urgent need to explore all the possibilities which should enable the Indian Government to receive information of internet commerce. The suggestion of the CBDT to form an International organisation with the participation of various countries needs to be implemented at the earliest because it would help in detecting commercial or financial transactions on the internet. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp; While various measures undertaken by the Government during the Post-Reform period deserve appreciation, there is need to implement such measures strictly and extend their scope. We think that there is an urgent need for reforms and improvement in the administration of direct taxes, even if it might mean increase in the cost of collection in the short-run. There is a need to lay adequate emphasis on achieving horizontal equity, i.e., equal treatment of equals in the long-run. The strength of the Income Tax Department needs to be Considerably increased to cater to the new challenges and to be in a position to develop a tax-system which would really be broad-based. 

<br> 

<br><strong>&nbsp; 3.</strong> What was CBDT's suggestion and Why?<br><br><strong>Options: 

</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong> To form an International organisation with the participation of various countries needs to be implemented at the earliest because it would help in detecting commercial or financial transactions on the internet. 

<br><strong>Option (b): </strong>Since internet is too slow, no International transactions required for the country at the moment. 

<br><strong>Option (c):</strong>&nbsp;Countries participation in formation of International organisation is not required at the moment.<br><strong>Option (d):</strong> None of the above.<br></p>

<br>&nbsp; According to Swami Ram Tirth, there are two types of selves-little self, i.e., our body which is composed of all sense organs and the purest sell, i.e., our soul. Now in the first chapter of Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna throws away his Gandive and wants to run away from his Dharma, that is, he is not ready to fight for the sake of truth by arguing that there is no use of killing our own relatives, friends, gurus even for the kingdom of three lokas.

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;Bhagavad Gita teaches us self-love of the highest order So, a person is to develop himself so that he can shun love for little self and act according to the dictates of the purest self, i.e., soul So it is the realisation of the purest self when a person loves his soul than his actions and he becomes a useful member of the society.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 5 to 7):</strong> Read the passage below and answer the questions based on it. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;In Bridharanyak Upnishad. Yagnavalkya says to his wife Maitri that - "Husband loves his wife not for wife's sake but for the sake of the self and a wife loves her husband not for husband's sake but for own sake; mother loves her child not for child's sake but for own sake and a child love his mother not for mother's sake but for own sake". It means all the activities which we are doing in our ordinary business of life are guided by self-interest, i.e., love for our oneself. It is a love of oneself that urges to take those activities where we get pleasure and discard all these activities where pain is there. So everywhere self-interest or love for oneself is the guiding force. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;According to Swami Ram Tirth, there are two types of selves-little self, i.e., our body which is composed of all sense organs and the purest sell, i.e., our soul. Now in the first chapter of Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna throws away his Gandive and wants to run away from his Dharma, that is, he is not ready to fight for the sake of truth by arguing that there is no use of killing our own relatives, friends, gurus even for the kingdom of three lokas. Now this is the little self which is speaking in Arjuna. He is in the grip of Moha. He does not realise that his foes want dominion This type of Moha distracts one from one's dharma (duty), and have been oppressors and have heaped inequities on the just and the innocent. Arjuna justifies his dereliction of duty with fancy rationalization. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;Bhagavad Gita teaches us self-love of the highest order So, a person is to develop himself so that he can shun love for little self and act according to the dictates of the purest self, i.e., soul So it is the realisation of the purest self when a person loves his soul than his actions and he becomes a useful member of the society. Then he has no desire and no object to gratify himself His karmas are automatic as the sun shines As sun gives light to everybody irrespective of caste, creed and religion, in the same way, he works tor the welfare of everybody and he observes the same purest self. In brief, a journey from little sell to purest self constitutes Sustainable Human Development. 

<br> 

<br><strong>&nbsp;7.</strong> According to the passage what does Bhagavad Gita teach us?<br><br><strong>Options: 

<br>Option (a):</strong>&nbsp;Teaches self-love to the highest order. 

<br><strong>Option (b):&nbsp;</strong>Teaches us purest self to the highest order. 

<br><strong>Option (c):</strong> Teaches us little self to the highest order. 

<br><strong>Option (d): </strong>None of the above.<br></p>

Many of them have done innovative works of great importance, as, for instance, in respect of leather, glass and ceramics, sanitation, waste disposal, public hygiene and nutrition. Several other areas can be mentioned. However, outside agriculture and health, at the level of the community, the impact does not go much beyond demonstrations of what can be done. The extension links needed remain weak. The community as a whole and the body of workers specially concerned are not able to achieve large-scale technological upgradation. Of course, other conditions have also to be met, e.g, education, training, organizations, credit and marketing support, risk insurance, etc. In each area, appropriate local leaders have to be located, trained and supported.<br><br>&nbsp;The second is concerned with the implementation of the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution concerning Panchayats and Nagar Palikas. Upto the present the main attention has been on the question of elections and organisation and, to an extent still far from satisfactory, on provision of finance and devolution of resources. These are only the first steps. The eleventh and twelfth schedules of the constitution list the various developmental responsibilities which the Panchayats and the Nagar Palikas are expected to carry out. Considerable knowledge and experience exists already about the implications of each of the responsibilities, how these have been fulfilled in the past and the conditions by way of finance, training, organisation etc. which have to be met, so that the 1ocal self-governing organisations may really be in a position to carry out the tasks expected of them. If these are not carried out, Panchayati Raj as a concept will be discredited and disowned. The two amendments and the schedules have a major. bearing on Centre-State relations not only&nbsp;in&nbsp;terms&nbsp;of finance and distribution of powers, but also in terms of administrative relations between the Centre and the States and between the State level and Nagar Palikas and Panchayat institutions. Social scientists have the background and the training to analyse and bring out the issues, so that the right policy decisions are reached. While decisions have to be taken by appropriate agencies of Government, what decisions are reached and how they are carried into effect can be greatly assisted by the work of social scientists. Upto the present, neither at the Centre nor in the States, has the approach of effective devolution and transfer of responsibility been adequately worked out. An example of this is the current view that the Central Government should pass on funds directly to Gram Panchayats, bypassing State and district and block agencies.<br><br>&nbsp;A third area in which social scientists can make an effective contribution is the study of decision-making processes by which major policies and programmes are determined within the Government. Examples are abound in which far-reaching decisions are reached without full study of aspects which emerge before long as critical weaknesses greatly undermining gains expected from the decisions taken. Also, while in the past, the word of authority could pass muster, in the changing climate of public affairs, unless those affected are taken into genuine and transparent consultation before decisions are taken or announced, implementation is apt to<br>be thwarted. In particular, when radical changes in policy are in view, workers, supervisors and other staff need to be carried on board. Major policies demand a substantial measure of consensus in their support.<br><br>&nbsp;While Governments are now under compulsion to introduce greatly improved management and human resource development methods and practices and to profit from the innovations now taking place in large corporations both in India and the developed countries, their concerns are societal and their criteria will not be precisely those of private or public corporations. Social scientists from&nbsp;several&nbsp;fields - public administration, political science, economics, sociology, psychology, for instance-have a collective contribution to make to the strengthening and improvement of systems and methods of governance.

The two amendments and the schedules have a major. bearing on Centre-State relations not only in terms of finance and distribution of powers, but also in terms of administrative relations between the Centre and the States and between the State level and Nagar Palikas and Panchayat institutions. Social scientists have the background and the training to analyse and bring out the issues, so that the right policy decisions are reached. While decisions have to be taken by appropriate agencies of Government, what decisions are reached and how they are carried into effect can be greatly assisted by the work of social scientists. Upto the present, neither at the Centre nor in the States, has the approach of effective devolution and transfer of responsibility been adequately worked out. An example of this is the current view that the Central Government should pass on funds directly to Gram Panchayats, bypassing State and district and block agencies. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;A third area in which social scientists can make an effective contribution is the study of decision-making processes by which major policies and programmes are determined within the Government. Examples are abound in which far-reaching decisions are reached without full study of aspects which emerge before long as critical weaknesses greatly undermining gains expected from the decisions taken. Also, while in the past, the word of authority could pass muster, in the changing climate of public affairs, unless those affected are taken into genuine and transparent consultation before decisions are taken or announced, implementation is apt to 

<br>be thwarted. In particular, when radical changes in policy are in view, workers, supervisors and other staff need to be carried on board. Major policies demand a substantial measure of consensus in their support. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;While Governments are now under compulsion to introduce greatly improved management and human resource development methods and practices and to profit from the innovations now taking place in large corporations both in India and the developed countries, their concerns are societal and their criteria will not be precisely those of private or public corporations. Social scientists from several fields - public administration, political science, economics, sociology, psychology, for instance-have a collective contribution to make to the strengthening and improvement of systems and methods of governance. Nearer the grassroots, there is need 

<br>also for much education and training of functionaries as well as at the community level. We have a whole set of 

<br>comparatively new problems and opportunities in relation to which social scientists have much to contribute.<br><br><strong>&nbsp; 10. </strong>The term&nbsp;grassroots implies to?<br><br><strong>Options:</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong> between Centre-State level.<br><strong>Option (b):</strong>&nbsp;Community level.<br><strong>Option (c):&nbsp;</strong>the most basic level of an activity or organization.<br><strong>Option (d):</strong> International level.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions for Questions 22 to 26:</strong> Each question has a set of four sequentially ordered statements. Each statement can be classified as one of the following: 

<br>&nbsp; - <strong>Facts</strong>, which deal with pieces of information that one has heard, seen or read, and which are open to discovery or verification (the answer option indicates such a statement with an '<strong>F</strong>'). 

<br>&nbsp; - <strong>Inferences</strong>, which are conclusions drawn about the unknown, on the basis of the known (the answer option indicates such a statement with an '<strong>I</strong>'). 

<br>&nbsp; - <strong>Judgements</strong>, which are opinions that imply or disapproval of persons, objects, situations and occurrences in the past, the present or the future (the answer option indicates such a statement with a '<strong>J</strong>').

<br>&nbsp;Choose the answer that best describes the set of four statements. Example: '<strong>JIJF</strong>' for

<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement D:</strong> as Fact.<br><br><strong>&nbsp;Statement A:</strong> People, it seems, are rather more prejudiced than they think they are.<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement B:</strong> All the polls predicted that Likud, Yisrael Beitenu, and four small rightist-religious parties would together muster 65 or more seats, whereas Kadima, Labour and their leftist allies would have 55 or fewer.<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement C:</strong> Whether these small differences in what are essentially artificial tasks really reflect day-to-day actions and choices was, until recently, untested.<br><strong>&nbsp;Statement D: </strong>But for lending to continue, the government may need to inject fresh capital into the banks.<br></p>
