<br><strong>&nbsp;2.</strong> It must be so massive to be a sphere under its own gravitational force, and 

<br><strong>&nbsp;3.</strong> It must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, i.e. it must not intersect the orbits of other planets or satellites in the orbit. 

<br>&nbsp;According to IAU "clearing the neighborhood" means that the planet must be a dominant body in its orbit, so that during its interaction with other bodies either it may consume them or push them away with its force of gravity. Pluto could not meet this condition because it is not a massive body as it is only 0.07 time mass of other objects in its orbit while earth is 1.7 million times the mass of other objects in its orbit. Now Pluto has been given the status of "dwarf planet" as 134340 Pluto and is the second largest dwarf planet in the Solar System after Eris and 10th largest body orbiting the Sun. Pluto is considered as the largest member of Kuiper Belt, which is a ring of objects ranging from 30 Astronomical Unit (AU) to 50 AU away from the Sun.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 6 to 8):&nbsp;Answer the following question based on passage.<br></strong><br>&nbsp; As neuroimaging techniques have become, more sophisticated, researchers have been intrigued at the possibility that these techniques could shed light on the nature of consciousness, and what brain structures control various aspects of consciousness. Thus, magnetic resonance imagery, electroencephalograms, and positron emission tomography are all being used to image the brain of people in various forms of consciousness, Including people sleeping, people in a coma, and people who have recently learned how to meditate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;One group of researchers, however, is interested in the differences in brain structure and functioning between everyday people and those who are expert at achieving altered state of consciousness. Specifically, these researchers have been using neuroimaging techniques to understand the effects of long-time practice of meditation on brain functioning (see Lutz, Dunne, &amp; Davidson, 2007). The participants in these studies have been experienced Buddhist mediators (with over 10,000 hour of cumulative meditation practice) and newly trained novice mediators. In one study (Brefczynskilewis, Lutz, &amp;. Davidson, 2004), participants performed a focused attention meditation in which the mind is focused singularly and unwaveringly on an individual object (a white dot on the screen). Magnetic resonance imagery showed that both the experts and the novices showed increased activation in areas of the brain associated with attention during the meditation phase of the study, as compared to a rest phase. However, the experts showed even greater activity in these attention areas than the experts while meditating. In contrast, the novices showed greater activity than the experts in areas of the brain associated with detecting errors, possibly because they were having more difficulty maintaining their concentration and thus diverting their attention away from the white dot more often.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In another study, these researchers had Buddhist practitioners and novices engage in a form of meditation in which they were to generate an unconditional feeling of loving-kindness and compassion. Neuroimaging showed that while in this state, both the experts and novices showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with positive emotions and the planning of movements, but the experts showed greater activity in these areas than the novices. The researchers interpreted these data as suggesting that a conscious state of loving-kindness toward others involves both emotional processing and an inclination to act on these feelings.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;These studies raise intriguing questions about how practicing certain states of consciousness, as in mediation, can actually change the functioning of the brain. They also raise hope that training certain mental activities may help to generate new or altered activity in the brain, which could prove therapeutic for individuals with brain damage or deficiencies. Do these studies tell us anything, however, about the nature of consciousness? One impediment to understanding consciousness is the fact that we still must rely on individuals' self-report to determine what is, or is not, going through their mind. Thus, although sophisticated neuroimaging techniques can give us pictures of the activity associated with consciousness, they can't give us a direct lens on consciousness itself.<br><strong><br></strong><strong>&nbsp; 6. Why do novices show greater activity than the experts in areas of the brain associated with detecting errors?<br></strong><br><strong>Options:</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong> Difficulty maintaining their concentration and thus diverting their attention away from the white dot more often.<br><strong>Option (b):</strong> Because their consciousness won't let them.<br><strong>Option (c):</strong> Due to regular mediation, brain doesn't function properly.<br><strong>Option (d):</strong> None of these.<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>Question No. 07: MCQ (with negative marking)</strong></h4> 

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 6 to 8):&nbsp;Answer the following question based on passage.<br></strong> 

<br>&nbsp; As neuroimaging techniques have become, more sophisticated, researchers have been intrigued at the possibility that these techniques could shed light on the nature of consciousness, and what brain structures control various aspects of consciousness. Thus, magnetic resonance imagery, electroencephalograms, and positron emission tomography are all being used to image the brain of people in various forms of consciousness, Including people sleeping, people in a coma, and people who have recently learned how to meditate. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp; One group of researchers, however, is interested in the differences in brain structure and functioning between everyday people and those who are expert at achieving altered state of consciousness. Specifically, these researchers have been using neuroimaging techniques to understand the effects of long-time practice of meditation on brain functioning (see Lutz, Dunne, &amp; Davidson, 2007). The participants in these studies have been experienced Buddhist mediators (with over 10,000 hour of cumulative meditation practice) and newly trained novice mediators. In one study (Brefczynskilewis, Lutz, &amp;. Davidson, 2004), participants performed a focused attention meditation in which the mind is focused singularly and unwaveringly on an individual object (a white dot on the screen). Magnetic resonance imagery showed that both the experts and the novices showed increased activation in areas of the brain associated with attention during the meditation phase of the study, as compared to a rest phase. However, the experts showed even greater activity in these attention areas than the experts while meditating. In contrast, the novices showed greater activity than the experts in areas of the brain associated with detecting errors, possibly because they were having more difficulty maintaining their concentration and thus diverting their attention away from the white dot more often. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp; In another study, these researchers had Buddhist practitioners and novices engage in a form of meditation in which they were to generate an unconditional feeling of loving-kindness and compassion. Neuroimaging showed that while in this state, both the experts and novices showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with positive emotions and the planning of movements, but the experts showed greater activity in these areas than the novices. The researchers interpreted these data as suggesting that a conscious state of loving-kindness toward others involves both emotional processing and an inclination to act on these feelings. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp; These studies raise intriguing questions about how practicing certain states of consciousness, as in mediation, can actually change the functioning of the brain. They also raise hope that training certain mental activities may help to generate new or altered activity in the brain, which could prove therapeutic for individuals with brain damage or deficiencies. Do these studies tell us anything, however, about the nature of consciousness? One impediment to understanding consciousness is the fact that we still must rely on individuals' self-report to determine what is, or is not, going through their mind. Thus, although sophisticated neuroimaging techniques can give us pictures of the activity associated with consciousness, they can't give us a direct lens on consciousness itself.

<br>&nbsp;A.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Directions (for questions 21 to 26): Read the passage below and&nbsp;answer&nbsp;the questions based on it.<br></strong><br>&nbsp;1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Women activists, women's organizations, and even ordinary housewives in rural areas have started struggling hard over the past several years to convince men against liquor consumption and force governments to introduce prohibition. They are demanding that they will vote only for&nbsp;parties committed to prohibition in their poll manifestoes. It was in 1993 that&nbsp;a small group of neo-literate women in Dabbagunta village in Nellore district in Andhra Pradesh, fed up with the drunkenness of their men, attacked a liquor shop, drove away its owners and destroyed the stocks of arrack. The spark provided by the unorganized women of a<br>small dusty village caught the imagination of the womenfolk all over Andhra Pradesh, from where the agitation spread to other states in the country. Recently (early 1996), 40 women from states participated in a two day national workshop on "Anti-Arrack Struggles" jointly sponsored by the National Commission for Women and Mahila Haat. The participants discussed the question of strengthening their area-based struggles against this social evil.<br><br>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, before the anti-arrack struggle took off, 70 per cent of men were drunkards and 70 per cent of their daily wage was dissipated on arrack but since the introduction of arrack prohibition household disposal incomes have nearly doubled. In one year, a saving of Rs. 7 crore has been mobilized in the district by rural Women (The Hindustan Times, April 10, 1996). Women's anti-arrack<br>movement in Andhra Pradesh is trying to make the government realize that prohibition is necessary to save the future generations. Wherever possible, they try to obstruct the auction of liquor licence.<br><br>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; The battle against arrack being not only Andhra Pradesh women's movement but a general social movement, women in almost every state are fighting it tooth and nail. Chhatisgarh Mahila Mandal in Madhya Pradesh, Uttrakhand Mahila Manch, Pauri Garhwal in Uttar Pradesh, Mahila Mandals in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, etc., are trying to make their anti-arrack agitation successful by gheraoing liquor shops, breaking bhattis where illicit liquor is produced, stopping 1liquor auctioning, and resorting to bottle phoro&nbsp;abhiyan,&nbsp;shouting slogans and getting thousands of signatures demanding a ban on liquor.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; With the failure of the prohibition model, state governmental control has come to be focused on the regulation of the liquor trade. The state governments, under the open license system, leave the alcoholic beverage trade to private enterprise under licensing and regulation, the nominal public objectives being to eliminate people with criminal or questionable financial histories and to control the physical location of licensed liquor shops. Every state government earns crores of rupees every year when it auctions the contracts.<br><br>&nbsp;5.&nbsp; Radicals argue that as long as our social structure and economic system continues to produce inequality, unemployment, poverty, injustice, and role-strains and tensions, alcoholism will persist. Since the present social systems operating in our society produce more frustrations and deprivations, the rate of drinking would only accelerate in future. What is, therefore, needed is a policy and programme to produce more jobs, permit fair competition and reduce corruption and nepotism in appointments and promotions. If the lives of people are made meaningful, rewarding and satisfying, the need for alcohol would not exist or it will be minimized. Secondly, education about the harm and hurt that alcohol can bring to a person's life and to society will help control the use of alcohol. Parents can impart education on the dangers of becoming an alcoholic as well as punish the deviants and create the necessary fear. Parents' education should be concerned with shaping the attitudes and behaviour conducive to non-drinking. Lastly, schools and colleges can also educate young students about the psychological and sociological effects of alcohol and alcoholism.<br><br>&nbsp;6.&nbsp; It is indeed a tragedy that our governments and political parties have not been able to follow the ideals we cherished during our struggle for independence. Gandhiji could not think of an independent India without prohibition. For him, prohibition was an integral part of the freedom movement. He categorically declared that if he were to be appointed dictator of the country for one hour, his first action would be to close all liquor shops without paying compensation. He was so emphatic in his assertions that he was even prepared to let the people go without education, if that was the price to be paid for introducing prohibition.&nbsp;According to him, the evil of drinking was worse than theft and even prostitution, as it was the mother of both these evils.<br><br><strong>&nbsp;21. What does the term&nbsp;'neo-literate' mean in paragraph 1?</strong><br><br><strong>Options:</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong> A neo-literate means is an adult or an adolescent who did not or could not make use of the available educational opportunities on time, and who at a later stage acquired the skills of literacy through formal or non-formal approaches.<br><strong>Option (b):</strong> A neo-literate is an adult or an adolescent who can make use of the available educational opportunities on time, and who at a later stage acquired the skills of literacy through formal approaches.<br><strong>Option (c):</strong> A neo-literate is an adult or an adolescent who has very basic educational acquired through formal or non-formal approaches.<br><strong>Option (d):</strong> A neo-literate is an adult or an adolescent who has maximum education acquired through formal or non-formal approaches.<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 21 to 26): Read the passage below and&nbsp;answer&nbsp;the questions based on it.<br></strong><br>&nbsp;1.   Women activists, women's organizations, and even ordinary housewives in rural areas have started struggling hard over the past several years to convince men against liquor consumption and force governments to introduce prohibition. They are demanding that they will vote only for parties committed to prohibition in their poll manifestoes. It was in 1993 that a small group of neo-literate women in Dabbagunta village in Nellore district in Andhra Pradesh, fed up with the drunkenness of their men, attacked a liquor shop, drove away its owners and destroyed the stocks of arrack. The spark provided by the unorganized women of a 

<br>small dusty village caught the imagination of the womenfolk all over Andhra Pradesh, from where the agitation spread to other states in the country. Recently (early 1996), 40 women from states participated in a two day national workshop on "Anti-Arrack Struggles" jointly sponsored by the National Commission for Women and Mahila Haat. The participants discussed the question of strengthening their area-based struggles against this social evil.<br> 

<br>&nbsp;2.   In Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, before the anti-arrack struggle took off, 70 per cent of men were drunkards and 70 per cent of their daily wage was dissipated on arrack but since the introduction of arrack prohibition household disposal incomes have nearly doubled. In one year, a saving of Rs. 7 crore has been mobilized in the district by rural Women (The Hindustan Times, April 10, 1996). Women's anti-arrack

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;4. With the failure of the prohibition model, state governmental control has come to be focused on the regulation of the liquor trade. The state governments, under the open license system, leave the alcoholic beverage trade to private enterprise under licensing and regulation, the nominal public objectives being to eliminate people with criminal or questionable financial histories and to control the physical location of licensed liquor shops. Every state government earns crores of rupees every year when it auctions the contracts. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;5. Radicals argue that as long as our social structure and economic system continues to produce inequality, unemployment, poverty, injustice, and role-strains and tensions, alcoholism will persist. Since the present social systems operating in our society produce more frustrations and deprivations, the rate of drinking would only accelerate in future. What is, therefore, needed is a policy and programme to produce more jobs, permit fair competition and reduce corruption and nepotism in appointments and promotions. If the lives of people are made meaningful, rewarding and satisfying, the need for alcohol would not exist or it will be minimized. Secondly, education about the harm and hurt that alcohol can bring to a person's life and to society will help control the use of alcohol. Parents can impart education on the dangers of becoming an alcoholic as well as punish the deviants and create the necessary fear. Parents' education should be concerned with shaping the attitudes and behaviour conducive to non-drinking. Lastly, schools and colleges can also educate young students about the psychological and sociological effects of alcohol and alcoholism. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;6. It is indeed a tragedy that our governments and political parties have not been able to follow the ideals we cherished during our struggle for independence. Gandhiji could not think of an independent India without prohibition. For him, prohibition was an integral part of the freedom movement. He categorically declared that if he were to be appointed dictator of the country for one hour, his first action would be to close all liquor shops without paying compensation. He was so emphatic in his assertions that he was even prepared to let the people go without education, if that was the price to be paid for introducing prohibition. According to him, the evil of drinking was worse than theft and even prostitution, as it was the mother of both these evils.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>Question No. 25: MCQ (with negative marking)</strong></h4> 

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 21 to 26): Read the passage below and&nbsp;answer&nbsp;the questions based on it.<br></strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;1. Women activists, women's organizations, and even ordinary housewives in rural areas have started struggling hard over the past several years to convince men against liquor consumption and force governments to introduce prohibition. They are demanding that they will vote only for parties committed to prohibition in their poll manifestoes. It was in 1993 that a small group of neo-literate women in Dabbagunta village in Nellore district in Andhra Pradesh, fed up with the drunkenness of their men, attacked a liquor shop, drove away its owners and destroyed the stocks of arrack. The spark provided by the unorganized women of a 

<br>small dusty village caught the imagination of the womenfolk all over Andhra Pradesh, from where the agitation spread to other states in the country. Recently (early 1996), 40 women from states participated in a two day national workshop on "Anti-Arrack Struggles" jointly sponsored by the National Commission for Women and Mahila Haat. The participants discussed the question of strengthening their area-based struggles against this social evil. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;2. In Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, before the anti-arrack struggle took off, 70 per cent of men were drunkards and 70 per cent of their daily wage was dissipated on arrack but since the introduction of arrack prohibition household disposal incomes have nearly doubled. In one year, a saving of Rs. 7 crore has been mobilized in the district by rural Women (The Hindustan Times, April 10, 1996). Women's anti-arrack 

<br>movement in Andhra Pradesh is trying to make the government realize that prohibition is necessary to save the future generations. Wherever possible, they try to obstruct the auction of liquor licence. 

<br> 

<br>&nbsp;3. The battle against arrack being not only Andhra Pradesh women's movement but a general social movement, women in almost every state are fighting it tooth and nail. Chhatisgarh Mahila Mandal in Madhya Pradesh, Uttrakhand Mahila Manch, Pauri Garhwal in Uttar Pradesh, Mahila Mandals in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, etc., are trying to make their anti-arrack agitation successful by gheraoing liquor shops, breaking bhattis where illicit liquor is produced, stopping 1liquor auctioning, and resorting to bottle phoro abhiyan, shouting slogans and getting thousands of signatures demanding a ban on liquor.
