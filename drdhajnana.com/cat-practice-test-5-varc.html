<br>&nbsp;During 1960s and 1970s the movement by the women to seek equality with men gained ground all over the world. With this movement called feminism, the educated women in particular and poor rural women in general realised the need to break the old shackles to breathe in the open space.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; Still the experience shows that man's tyrannical hegemony is overwhelmingly strong and deep rooted to allow for any change in the short run.

The burning of brides for dowry continue unabetted in the various parts of the country.<br><br>&nbsp; The condition of rural women is still more deplorable. The various women's movements are led and organised by white collared middle class women and social workers from upper and upper middle class non-working women who are unaware about the ground realities existing in the rural structure of Indian society<br>and are not concerned to the rural women's miserable conditions.<br><br>&nbsp; Women's organisation have lobbied heavily for the introduction&nbsp;of&nbsp;Women Reservation Bill for 33 per cent reservation in Lok Sabha and in state assembly seats.

Then answer the questions below.<br></strong><br>&nbsp;During 1960s and 1970s the movement by the women to seek equality with men gained ground all over the world. With this movement called feminism, the educated women in particular and poor rural women in general realised the need to break the old shackles to breathe in the open space.
<br>   
<br>&nbsp;Still the experience shows that man's tyrannical hegemony is overwhelmingly strong and deep rooted to allow for any change in the short run. In India a crime is committed against a women every seven minutes. Every 26 minutes a molestation take place and every 54 minute somewhere a woman is raped. The burning of brides for dowry continue unabetted in the various parts of the country.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;The condition of rural women is still more deplorable. The various women's movements are led and organised by white collared middle class women and social workers from upper and upper middle class non-working women who are unaware about the ground realities existing in the rural structure of Indian society

<br>&nbsp;Women's organisation have lobbied heavily for the introduction of Women Reservation Bill for 33 per cent reservation in Lok Sabha and in state assembly seats.

<br>
<br>&nbsp;The government has also taken various measures like committee on statues of women in 1974, followed by National Plan of Action for women and the National Perspective Plan for women in 1988. However despite of these measures, the challenges before the women for their emancipation has remained still an uphill task and their conditions still remained the same. What is required is the seriousness of the various government agencies to work for the women's empowerment by spreading awareness through various educative programmes.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;However, one can conclusion that inspite of the constitutional and legal guarantees aiming to eradicate
<br>the inequality and discrimination in any form, the plight of women still remained far from improved. Even today the evils like child marriage, evesteasing, sexual assaults, wife beating, female infanticide and gender discrimination are widely prevalent in the society.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The idea of India as a national-state is born out of its later history as a single colony. While Indian nationalism in general was perhaps engendered by the very imposition of a rule that for the first time planted the notion of an integrated identity, the ensuring national-state has been shaped and structured by its intelligentsia. The tradition of writing pan-Indian narratives in the production of nationalist ideology however, takes off from far older traditions. The shaping of history is not a single truthful act but a number of discloses based on different contextual positions and must, therefore, be looked upon sceptically.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>&nbsp; Which of the following can be the best possible conclusion for the above.<br></strong><br><strong>Options:</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong>&nbsp;To think of nationalism then as a unified movement would necessarily imply a general consent which could be defined only by popular belief.<br><strong>Option (b):</strong> To think of anti-nationalism then as a unified movement would necessarily imply a general consent which could be defined only by popular belief.<br><strong>Option (c): </strong>To think of secularism as a unified movement would necessarily imply a general consent which could be defined only by popular belief.<br><strong>Option (d):&nbsp;</strong>None of the above.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp; </strong>Lata and Sandhya are both successful women who are also members of a socially disadvantaged section of the society. Lata has a firm belief in positive discrimination. By positive discrimination she believes that the negative discrimination that society has subjected her section of the society to can only be offset through reverse discrimination. She believes that if positions of economic, social and political eminence, power and honor are offered principally to historically disadvantaged sections of society, then these groups will begin to play a more significant role in society today. Sandhya, on the other hand, feels that she has succeeded in her chosen field of work on her hard work and on her own merits. She thinks that the principle of positive discrimination is flawed since it will result in the lowering of standards and decreases competition between similarly qualified personnel who will expect to achieve positions because of their factors rather than their suitability for the particular position.<br><br><strong>&nbsp; Which of the following best sums up Sandhya's argument?<br></strong><br><strong>Options:</strong><br><strong>Option (a):</strong> Positive discrimination will encourage more people to apply for jobs, previously unavailable to them.<br><strong>Option (b):</strong> Positive discrimination will give extra opportunities to socially disadvantaged sections of the society.<br><strong>Option (c):</strong> Outcome of positive discrimination will be lowering of standards and decreases competition between similarly qualified personnel who will expect to achieve positions because of their factors rather than their suitability for the particular position.<br><strong>Option (d):</strong> Positive discrimination will remove deep rooted prejudices against the weaker sections of society from the work arena.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In India in 1990, there were, on an average 14 deaths at birth (infant mortality) per 1,000 population. By 2000 there were 11, and by 2001, 8. Today, there are 5 deaths at birth per 1,000 population, and it was anticipated that the downward trend will continue. But to everyone's shock it has climbed to 30 by 2022. Each of the following, if true, would help account for this trend except<br><br><strong>Options:</strong><br><strong>Option (a): </strong>Medical care is more widespread and available.<br><strong>Option (b): </strong>More effective birth control methods have been implemented.<br><strong>Option (c):</strong> The number of deaths per 1,000 population has increased.<br><strong>Option (d):</strong> Midwifery has declined in favor of doctors.<br></p>

<br><strong>&nbsp;A:&nbsp;The Constitution of India recognize eighteen 'official regional' languages, Hindi as the 'national official' language and English as a link language between Hindi and non Hindi states.</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;B:&nbsp;</strong>One aspect of the language problem in India is that no language is&nbsp;spoken by an absolute majority of the people and even Hindi, the most widely spoken language is used by only about 42% of the total population<br>India.<br><strong>&nbsp;C:</strong>&nbsp;The problem could not be solved even through the creation of linguistic states.<br><strong>&nbsp;D:</strong>&nbsp;A major confrontation of the language issue, however, is the declaration of Hindi as the National official language which has led to Anti-Hindi agitations in many parts of the country especially in Tamil Nadu in the South.<br><strong>&nbsp;E:&nbsp;</strong>Thus, at the national level, there is no linguistic majority. But in almost each state, there are several linguistic minorities.<br><strong>&nbsp;F:&nbsp;Even though introduction of the language 'formula sought to solve the language issue to some extent, poor implementation has meant that the problem continues&nbsp;to&nbsp;hang&nbsp;fire.</strong><br><br><strong>Options:
