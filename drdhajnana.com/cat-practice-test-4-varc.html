Though in simple teams, squaring is a process of multiplying the same number to itself, but when we talk about the geometrical figure square, there also we find the same result for the value of area, which is obtained by multiplying the value of side to itself. The reference of this word we find in several geometrical theorems and during ancient times it was used even in ‘Sulva Sutras’. Bodhayan and Pythagoras have established the relationship between the sides of any right angled triangle, where again the notion of square was used by them to find the values. Such paraphrasing of this word square make the meaning somehow clear, where at every place, a number is multiplied to itself to find the square value. But if we look back to trace the process of emergence of this particular idea of multiplying a number to itself, it seems that with the introduction of operation of multiplication, the primitive people also used most likely the concept of square. Neolithic people though have not left any concrete evidences their acquaintance either with arithmetic or geometry, but their drawings and design patterns of some structures some sort of congruence and symmetry. They were probably aware about the fact that sums of consecutive odd numbers beginning unity are perfect squares.<br><br>&nbsp;Now we illustrate “Duplex Method” to find square value which is suitable to all numbers and before finding the square first we find Duplex for different numbers of one digit, two digits, three digits, four digits etc., and denote in general Duplex of any number by D.<br><br>&nbsp;The first one is by squaring; and the second one is by cross- multiplication. In the present context, it is used in both senses (a² and 2ab). In the case of a single central digit, the square is meant; and in the case of an even number of digits equidistant from the two ends, double the cross-product is meant.<br><br>&nbsp; To find the square of a fractional (decimal) number, we square the number without looking at decimal. After that we count the number of digits after the decimal in the original value.

<br></strong>
<br>&nbsp;When we come across the word Square it immediately gets related with our experience and has some resemblance with the geometric figure named as square. Though in simple teams, squaring is a process of multiplying the same number to itself, but when we talk about the geometrical figure square, there also we find the same result for the value of area, which is obtained by multiplying the value of side to itself.

But if we look back to trace the process of emergence of this particular idea of multiplying a number to itself, it seems that with the introduction of operation of multiplication, the primitive people also used most likely the concept of square. Neolithic people though have not left any concrete evidences their acquaintance either with arithmetic or geometry, but their drawings and design patterns of some structures some sort of congruence and symmetry. They were probably aware about the fact that sums of consecutive odd numbers beginning unity are perfect squares.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Now we illustrate “Duplex Method” to find square value which is suitable to all numbers and before finding the square first we find Duplex for different numbers of one digit, two digits, three digits, four digits etc., and denote in general Duplex of any number by D.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;The first one is by squaring; and the second one is by cross- multiplication. In the present context, it is used in both senses (a² and 2ab). In the case of a single central digit, the square is meant; and in the case of an even number of digits equidistant from the two ends, double the cross-product is meant.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; To find the square of a fractional (decimal) number, we square the number without looking at decimal. After that we count the number of digits after the decimal in the original value. In the squared value, we place the decimal after double the number of digits after decimal in the original value.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; If there are n digits in a number, the square will have either 2n or 2n-l digits and participation of digits follows the same systematic pattern as in multiplication.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Example: 46325²
<br>
<br>&nbsp; = D of 4 | D of 46 | D of 463 | D of 4632 | D of 46325 | D of 6325 | D of 325 | D of 25 | D of 5
<br>     
<br>&nbsp; Let d = digit, 46325 = d₄ = 4, d₃ = 6, d₂ = 3, d₁ = 2, d₀ = 5.
<br><br>&nbsp; = (d₄ x d₄)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| (d₄ x d₃) + (d₄ x d₃)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| (d₄ x d₂) + (d₄ x d₂) + (d₃ x d₃)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| (d₄ x d₁) + (d₄ x d₁) + (d₃ x d₂) + (d₃ x d₂)

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| (d₃ x d₀) + (d₃ x d₀) + (d₂ x d₁) + (d₂ x d₁)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| (d₂ x d₀) + (d₂ x d₀) + (d₁ x d₁)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| (d₁ x d₀) + (d₁ x d₀)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| (d₀ x d₀)
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Replacing the values of d₀, d₁, d₂, d₃ and d₄, upon solving.

<br>
<br>&nbsp;The advent and growth of financial journalism which publishes regularly success stories also induces the managers to excel each other and feel a sense of pride in the publication of news about them and their firms. The financial journals also conducted and publish analysis about the various firms in a particular industry and naturally the major players in that particular industry will not like to be unfavourably Commented upon.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>Question No. 11: MCQ (with negative marking)</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 8 to 12): Read the passage below and answer the questions based on it.
<br></strong><br>&nbsp;The firm and its managers have to develop their ability to compete effectively not only to grow but also to survive. It is only under the pressure of competition that a firm would try to improve its product and raise its productivity. Competition itself is not static but is profoundly dynamic in character. To gain a competitive advantage, firms very often add distinct product varieties, adopt multiple distribution channels and cater to several different types of customers. Markets are segmented according to their differing needs and an attempt is made to satisfy those needs. An unadvertised basic shirt and a designer shirt like Charagh Din are both shirts but are sold to buyers with very different criteria.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Firms can develop a competitive advantage to serve a segment that they are capable of serving. In general, the advantage can be acquired or developed either in the form of lower costs or through differentiation of products that command premium prices. Tea City provides an example how premium prices can be charged for a common place product like tea. Hindustan Leaver's Surf competes not on the basis of price but on the basis of non-price factors. Firms can gain and sustain competitive advantage by constant upgradation and improvement of their products. Manufacturers in Ludhiana and Japan have one point of similarity. Both of them have ability to dismantle a product and duplicate it effectively. The similarity ends here. While Ludhiana will continue to produce exact duplicates, Japanese manufacturers will try to improve upon the product. Japanese automakers invaded the US market on the basis of their compact cars and captured about thirty per cent of the US automobile market. But when compelled by the USA to voluntarily restrict their car exports and to overcome the disadvantage of an appreciating Yen, they tried to upgrade their cars and added value to them and thus prevented a decline in the dollar value of their automobile exports.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;If your product is better, you can improve your market share even when there is an overall decline in industry demand. Take the case of two wheelers in India. While the overall industry demand has declined, Bajaj Auto increased its share from 60 per cent in 1990 to 64 per cent in 1991 and Kinetic Honda has increased its share from 8 per cent to 11 per cent. But with the advent of new models to target every <strong>niche </strong>by its competitors, Bajaj Auto continuously witnessed a decline in its market share.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Existence of intense rivalry among the various firms is the most important factor leading to a continuous improvement in products. Intense rivalry causes the various rival firms to improve and innovate. They push each other to lower costs, improve quality and service and create new products and processes. Keen competition between various firms may lead to closure of some but those who remain would be strong survivors capable of defending themselves against foreign competitors and competing with them in their
<br>home ground. This is what happened in Japan. While external competition was not allowed, there was no holds barred for internal competition. Japanese companies tried their best to out do each other and in the process improved themselves.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;The advent and growth of financial journalism which publishes regularly success stories also induces the managers to excel each other and feel a sense of pride in the publication of news about them and their firms. The financial journals also conducted and publish analysis about the various firms in a particular industry and naturally the major players in that particular industry will not like to be unfavourably Commented upon.<br>
<br><strong>&nbsp; According to the passage, Role of&nbsp;financial journalism in encouraging&nbsp;managers and their firms includes which of the following,</strong><br><strong><br></strong>&nbsp;A: Publish regularly success stories also induces the managers to excel each other and feel a sense of pride in the publication of news about them and their firms.<br>&nbsp;B: Conducted and publish analysis about the various firms in a particular industry.<br>&nbsp;C: Firms&nbsp;of financial journalism can develop a competitive advantage to serve a segment that they are capable of serving.<br>&nbsp;D:&nbsp;Financial journalism do not play any role of financial journalism in encouraging managers and their firms.<br><br><strong>Options:</strong><br><strong> Option (a): </strong>A and B<br><strong> Option (b): </strong>B and C<br><strong>Option (c): </strong>D and C<br><strong>Option (d): </strong>B and D<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>Question No. 19: MCQ (with negative marking)</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Directions (for questions 16 to 20): Read the passage below and answer the questions based on it.
<br></strong>
<br>&nbsp;It is perhaps a commentary on man that, when one wishes to speak of peace, one must inevitably speak of war. The simple definition of peace seems to be the freedom from war and quietness of mind. War involves two or more hostile states in armed conflict, with one or more seeking a goal which is actively opposed by the others. In seeking peace we are primarily concerned with the causes of war. In the era of superpower rivalry it was felt that to be prepared for war was one of the most effective means of preserving peace.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;At first hearing, this piece of advice sounds plausible. It means that if a nation is well-armed and ready for war, other nations will be chary of attacking it. In this way it will avoid war and have peace. Whereas an unarmed nation will be an easy prey to any enemy. No doubt there is an element of truth in this. In the present state of the world, no nation is safe that relies for its safety solely on the honour and good-will of its neighbours. Witness the fate of Belgium in the first Great War. In spite of our boasted civilization, and the fine sentiments
<br>expressed by governments, politicians and the press, the weak is still the prey of the strong, might is still right, and the final appeal is still to brute force. So long as this state of affairs lasts, any nation is foolish that is not prepared to defend its liberty by force of arms.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;This is the policy followed by India and Pakistan. This was the policy followed by the US and former USSR and it is the policy which continues to be followed in many parts of the world.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;But does preparation for war really make for peace? Let us examine this statement, as we would ring a doubtful coin. A tree must be judged by its fruits. In 1914. all the big nations of Europe (except, perhaps, England) were armed to the teeth. Europe was an armed camp, fully prepared for war. What was the
<br>result? Peace? No, War the most widespread and devastating war in the world's history. It was the enormous enlargement of armies and fleets, the crushing burden of ever growing armaments, and the mutual fear and suspicion engendered thereby, which finally resulted in the explosion of the first Great War.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;The lesson of that Great War is that if you prepare for war you will have war - war, not peace. This has Since then been proved time and time again the second world war, in the wars between India and Pakistan, in the Gulf war That method of securing peace has failed and failed lamentably.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Bertrand Russel in his "Which Way to Peace" pointed Out : "The universal apprehension is itself a potent cause of war. Fear of war is used to justify armaments, armaments increase the fear of war; and the fear of war increases the likelihood of war."
<br>
<br>&nbsp;We must take another motto: If you would have peace, prepare tor Peace. Let the nations prepare for peace, by cultivating mutual goodwill, by the amicabie settlement of disputes by arbitration, by agreeing to universal disarmament, by friendly cooperation instead of suspicious rivalry.
<br><strong><br>&nbsp;According to passage, what is the&nbsp;lesson of Great War?<br></strong><br><strong>Options:<br>Option (a):</strong>&nbsp;If you prepare for war you will have peace. <br><strong>Option (b):</strong>  If you prepare for peace you will have peace.<br><strong>Option (c):</strong>  Peace is not&nbsp;Permanent.<br><strong>Option (d): </strong>If you prepare for war you will have war - war, not peace.<br></p>
